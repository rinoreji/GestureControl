# Gesture Control
Allows you to start/stop process and execute shortcuts via mouse gestures

Application runs in the notification bar, you can configure gesture and commands from the configure window.

I will continue working on this to make command-gesture mapping easier. Ideas/Issues/Pull requests are most welcomed.

(Gesture control uses [Mouse Gestures for .NET](http://mousegestures.codeplex.com/) for 'Mouse gestures recognition'.
